Version 1.2.7 - 2005-12-22  - Doodle
 - Added support for proportional SDL windows.
   There are two ways to have proportional (aspect-keeping) windows for
   a given SDL application: Either set the SDL_USE_PROPORTIONAL_WINDOW
   environment variable to something before starting the application
   (e.g.: 
    SET SDL_USE_PROPORTIONAL_WINDOW=1
    dosbox.exe
   )
   or, if you have the HOME environment variable set, then SDL.DLL will
   create a file in that directory called .sdl.proportionals, and you can
   put there the name of executable files that will be automatically made
   proportional.

Version 1.2.7 - 2005-10-14  - Doodle
 - Enabled Exception handler code in FSLib to be able to restore original
   desktop video mode in case the application crashes.
 - Added the missing FSLib_Uninitialize() call into SDL.
   (The lack of it did not cause problems, but it's cleaner this way.)
 - Fixed a mouse problem in Fullscreen mode where any mouse click
   re-centered the mouse.

Version 1.2.7 - 2005-10-09  - Doodle

Version 1.2.7 - 2005-10-03  - Doodle
 - Reworked semaphore support again
 - Tuned thread priorities

Version 1.2.7 - 2005-10-02  - Doodle
 - Added support for custom mouse pointers
 - Fixed WM_CLOSE processing: give a chance to SDL app to ask user...
 - Added support for MMX-accelerated audio mixers
 - Other small fixes

Version 1.2.7 - 2005-09-12  - Doodle
 - Small fixes for DosBox incorporated into public release
 - Fixed semaphore support (SDL_syssem.c)
 - Fixed FSLib to have good clipping in scaled window mode,
   and to prevent occasional desktop freezes.

Version 1.2.7 - 2004-09-08a - Caetano
	- Improved joystick support (general verifications about hardware).
	- Added support up to 8 buttons in 2 axes joysticks and 6 buttons in 3 axes joysticks.
	- Added support to environment variable SDL_OS2_JOYSTICK to specify a joystick.
	- Improved Joystick test to handle every type of joystick and display only relevant information.
	- Merged with Doodle 2004-09-08
	- Little tid up in README.OS2
	- Added explanation about SDL_OS2_JOYSTICK environment variable on README.OS2

Version 1.2.7 - 2004-09-07 - Caetano
	- Merged with changes in headers for GCC compiling.
	- Added Joystick support using basic IBM GAME$ support, allowing it to work with all joystick drivers since OS/2 2.1.
	- Improved joystick detection (hacked!). OS/2 do not allow real joystick detection, so... 
	- Modified makefile in test to compile "testjoystick". Anyway, it's useless, since it seems to cause a lot of trouble in OS/2 (because os video routines, not Joystick support).
	- Created separated Joystick test program to test only joystick functions.
	- Improved joystick auto-centering.
	- Improved the coordinate correction routine to use two scale factors for each axis.

Version 1.2.7 - 2004-07-05 - Caetano
	- Corrected the time returned by status in CDROM support (it was incorrect)
	- Added the testcdrom.c and corrected the linking directive (it was causing an error)

Version 1.2.7 - 2004-07-02a - Caetano
	- Corrected a little problem in a comment at SDL-1.2.7\test\torturethread.c, line 18 (missing */, nested comment)
	- Added CDROM support to tree (SDL-1.2.7\src\cdrom\os2\SDL_syscdrom.c)
	- Modified makefile (SDL-1.2.7\src\makefiles.wat and SDL-1.2.7\watcom.mif) to build with CDROM support
	- Added the "extra" SDL_types.h forgotten in 2004-07-02 version.
